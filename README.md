> “There are ideas that do not describe the world: they precede it.”  
> This is the first physical body ever given to the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function.

## 🔥 The Core Idea

The imaginary parts γₙ of the nontrivial Riemann zeta zeros are no longer abstract numbers on a critical line.

They are now **living frequencies** inside a real, stable, self-organizing nonlinear organism composed of thousands of adaptive Stuart–Landau oscillators.

A 165-year-old mathematical myth has found a body.  
The zeros have become sound, geometry, synchronization, and energy.

This is **the Riemann Organ**.
